# BackbaseTask

## Architecture:

I followed the View-Interactor-Presenter-Entity-Router (VIPER) design pattern and I used modern app development practices including xib and Auto Layout. 

Also I made unit testing for Cities Module.

Note: I used no third party libraries.


**Note this branch I implemented binary search as POC but it turns out not that the performace is not great which is m(log(n)), So I believe the tree is much better**
